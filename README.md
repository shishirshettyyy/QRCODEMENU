# Udupi Kitchen üç≤‚ú®

## What‚Äôs Cooking?
Hey, welcome to **Udupi Kitchen**! This little web app is my spin on a modern restaurant vibe. I whipped it up with **Vite + React** for a super-fast frontend, **Node.js/Express.js** for the backend, and **MongoDB** to keep everything stored. You can scan a **QR code**, check out the menu, save your favorite dishes, and even tweak things as an admin‚Äîtasty and techy all at once!

## How It Works
- **For Food Lovers**: Grab your phone, scan the QR code, and dive into the menu‚Äîsearch, filter, and tap a heart to save what you love.
- **For Admins**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+A`, type in your secret admin key, and start adding new dishes, tweaking prices, or kicking out old ones.
- **The Kitchen Magic**: **MongoDB** holds all the menu goodies, while **QRCode** zaps you right to the action.

## Tech That Sizzles
- **Vite + React**: Quick and lively frontend fun
- **Node.js/Express.js**: Solid APIs with a kick
- **MongoDB**: Keeps the menu fresh and ready
- **QRCode**: Instant menu access, no fuss
- **Axios**: Smooth talks with the server

## Try It Out
1. Snag it: `git clone https://github.com/shishirshettyyy/QRCODEMENU.git`
2. Get it ready: `npm install` (frontend and backend)
3. Add some spice: Toss `MONGO_URI=your-mongo-uri`, `ADMIN_KEY=your-secret`, and `PORT=5000` into a `.env` file
4. Fire it up: `node server.js` & `npm run dev`
5. Dig in: Head to `http://localhost:5173`

## Cool Bites Inside
- **QR Trick**: Scan and boom‚Äîyou‚Äôre on the menu page.
- **Filter Party**: Sort by price or category in a snap.
- **Favorites**: Heart your go-to dishes to keep ‚Äòem handy.
- **Admin Flow**: Add, tweak, or ditch items like a pro.

## Challenges I Savored
- Took some fiddling to get **QRCode** linking just right across devices.
- Tweaked the filters and search to feel smooth and natural.
- Loved keeping the UI zippy with Vite‚Äôs fast reloads.

## What‚Äôs Simmering Next?
- A mobile-friendly glow-up with Tailwind CSS.
- Maybe an ordering system for takeout dreams.
- An admin dashboard to track the foodie stats.
